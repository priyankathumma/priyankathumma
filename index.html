      <h1>Water Conservation</h1>
      <p>Water conservation encompasses the policies, strategies and activities made to manage fresh water as a sustainable resource,
         to protect the water environment, and to meet current and future human demand. Population, household size,
         and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used. Factors such as climate change have increased
         pressures on natural water resources especially in manufacturing and agricultural irrigation.</p>
